-Redo envelope graphing in dx7envdisplay.js to accuarately mimic the envelope generators:
--Exponential value display to match the exponential operator level control (db-like).
--Sync time scale of all envelopes, otherwise all envelopes show up in different timescales and there is no intuitive feedback how the operators work together over time
--Maybe mash all oscillator envelopes into one display, using different colors for each.
